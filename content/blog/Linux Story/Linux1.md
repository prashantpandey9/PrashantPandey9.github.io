I recently shifted from Windows8 to Ubuntu18.04(LTS). It's very hard to take this decision for me , because at that time i do not know anything about the ubuntu version of linux. But when i shifted ,it was easy to execute same as windows does. It has very good GUI(Graphic User Interface) and I liked that it was most enjoyable part but when I installed  Ubuntu many problems occured at the that  time. I am listing some problems below.






### Installation Problem
I boot my pendrive with ubuntu18.04LTS and then  poweroff the laptop and start pressing F12 . Usually this is the key to open the boot sequence. Practically at that time i have no knowledge of installing an operating system in a laptop, so this is my first attemt for installing an operating system by myself. I completed installation steps and then a confusing page occured in which i have to delete the earliar OS from harddrive , I can't recognise which part to delete  because the format was  in sda or in its technical term so I have to calculate my partitions in hard disk so I quit that process and remove the pendrive. After that I reboot the laptop and calculate the partitons in windowa OS and again boot the pendrive . But when I again reach that step,the calculated partition in windows format and installing format were differrent. But when  I apply some approximation and deleted one partition and  when the installtion was  completed then I rebooted my laptop it shows an error message.

At that time I did'nt recognise why this error is poping up on my  laptop screen. 
I was nervous what happened to my laptop and then I rebooted it  again with my pen drive and started installation again, but when process completed , the error message remained constant. Then I asked my brother for help and  he gave me a link "How to fix the booting sequence of laptop in BIOS manager" .
