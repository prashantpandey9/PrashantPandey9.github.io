It's been a month now and I was learning about react and found something interesting about it.
Let's start with some introduction about the react, basically react is an open-source JavaScript library for building user interfaces or UI components. It is maintained by Facebook and a community of individual developers and companies. React can be used as a base in the development of single-page or mobile applications.

I was very surprised when I used it for the first time. There are many features that are provided by it but I love the most was, it loads on one page only, means that it uses only one page of HTML and loads all the data in it with the help of another JavaScript library **"react-router-dom"** and one more feature was it can build your PWA(Progressive Web App) automatically without writing any extra code for it.

If you are building an app with this tool then it mainly consists of many pieces of code (in react called as components) which contain another feature of it which is, we can use HTML tags in the react components. The clue here is that any JSX tag gets translated to a React.createElement call and it renders on the HTML page using the **"react-dom"** library.

So these are the basic concepts of react, but react is bigger than this. It contains many other features also like state management system, props passing and many more.
