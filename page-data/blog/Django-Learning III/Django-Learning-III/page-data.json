At the first time i choose to learn the LARAVEL FRAMEWORK so i decided to install the laravel package in my system and tried to start some stuff by searching  the basic project in laravel. Then i come up with a search \"How to create a contact from with a laravel framework\" and i also take help by my elder brother. So we started a project file and copied some code from google. At the final we are able to setup the enviroment and created the whole contact form in just 15 min (Including Backend and Frontend) but i struggled with many problem in laravel and then i decided to search something related this framework. Then i decided to learn the Django Framework (beacuse i am comfortable with python).</p>\n<p>I recently installed the django environment in my system and start doing something. When i started doing some stuff in django. My interest kept growing day by day.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Django Learning I","date":"November, 04, 2019","path":"/blog/django/Django-Learning-I"}}},"pageContext":{"previous":{"frontmatter":{"title":"उलझन।","date":"2019-12-04","path":"/blog/poem/उलझन।"},"html":"<p>उन किस्सों को खत्म कर ,<br>\nउन बातों की उलझने खत्म कर ,<br>\nक्या मिला उन बातों को बोल कर,<br>\nआज भी उसी दर्द में जी रहा है तू!<br>\nप्यार की नाकामयाबी को भुला,<br>\nजिंदगी की उलझनों को सुलझा।</p>\n<p>चल एक नई शुरुआत करते है,<br>\nज़िंदगी के कठिन रास्तों पर एक साथ चलते हैं।<br>\nचल इस दोस्ती को मिसाल बनाकर नए रास्तों को खोजने निकलते है।<br>\nचल एक साथ चलते हैं।<br>\nचल एक साथ चलते हैं।<br>\n-प्रशांत</p>"},"next":{"frontmatter":{"title":"Django Learning II","date":"2019-11-25","path":"/blog/django/Django-Learning-II"},"html":"<h2>Week II</h2>\n<p>I recently tried many things with django framework but I didn't create anything with it. I started a project name todoapp which stores the daily work deatil and delete when  things are over. I have no idea how to create this type of app with django framework, so i googled it and found some stuff about creating a todoapp.</p>\n<p>I started creating the app  with full  enthusiasm. But  not able to create it by my own.I copied some code from google and migrate all the data into database and try to run the server. But I don't know why, the app created problem.I have no idea what's going with that code. I tried to remove error,  some effort got success but some effort not enough to remove the error.</p>\n<p>So till now that app is not working!!!</p>"},"post":{"node":{"frontmatter":{"title":"Django Learning III","date":"2019-12-03","path":"/blog/Django-Learning III/Django-Learning-III"},"html":"<p>I started a tutorial through a website and found many interesting thing about this tutorial.I created a new blog app from this guide line and learnt a lot.</p>\n<p>I started a django project by typing the command django-admin startproject and in this folder I created my app by typing the command django-admin startapp .These commands directs the django software in your machine and it creates many files related to this project. The hierarchy looks as follwing:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://blog.prashantpandey9.in/static/b3570ecd9a19a08080d8adc44c5e179b/2bef9/dj.png\" alt=\"DJ\"></p>\n<p>There are many files in it , but we need some files for creating small projects.At the begining of any project we have to register the application name in the settings.py  which consist the required things to control the application. After this we have to create the model for our project like ,if we are developing a contact page we need a Textblock  for name and E-mail  box. So we can add these fields in model.py to create a table to store these things in it. After creating a model we have to migrate the model into the database. Generally Django uses  its default database called sqlite. After all this we need views.py ,model.py and urls.py to connect them and put all the data to a html file which displays all the data which we are taking from a user or putting in it.</p>\n<p>The confusing thing about Django is that you often need 4 different but interconnected files for one webpage: models.py, urls.py, views.py, and a template html file.I find it easiest to reason about this by going in order from models -> urls -> views -> template files.</p>"}}}},
