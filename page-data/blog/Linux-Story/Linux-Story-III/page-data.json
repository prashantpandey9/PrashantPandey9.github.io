At the first time i choose to learn the LARAVEL FRAMEWORK so i decided to install the laravel package in my system and tried to start some stuff by searching  the basic project in laravel. Then i come up with a search \"How to create a contact from with a laravel framework\" and i also take help by my elder brother. So we started a project file and copied some code from google. At the final we are able to setup the enviroment and created the whole contact form in just 15 min (Including Backend and Frontend) but i struggled with many problem in laravel and then i decided to search something related this framework. Then i decided to learn the Django Framework (beacuse i am comfortable with python).</p>\n<p>I recently installed the django environment in my system and start doing something. When i started doing some stuff in django. My interest kept growing day by day.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Django Learning I","date":"November, 04, 2019","path":"/blog/django/Django-Learning-I"}}},"pageContext":{"previous":{"frontmatter":{"title":"Linux Story II","date":"2019-09-15","path":"/blog/Linux-Story-II/Linux-Story-II"},"html":"<p>When ubuntu installation completed I booted my laptop and it starts working again and I enjoyed the moment.

The folder is not created and then I start deleting the existing folder but it shows an error again. Then I started searching \"How to change read/write of a folder in a drive?\" and executed many commands related to this like $chmod 777 ~/file path but this changed the property of folder but not the harddrive partition.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://blog.prashantpandey9.in/static/714c8dc29822f7719c6d8277dcbc3e70/dba9a/error.png\" alt=\"commands\"></p>\n<p>Then I again searched for so many commands and executed them all but nothing happened. So I decided to ask to my brother again and he suggested the same solution which I executed earlier. Then he decided to  check my laptop  from his place, so i added \"Chrome Remote Desktop\" in Google Chrome. Then he checked the problem but nothing happened, and then he started searching problem again and this time he came up with a problem and its solution. The problem arrived from the Windows OS . When I removed the Windows Os from the PC, the Harddrive is locked due to its security purposes and then we found the solution.</p>\n<p>To fix the NTFS lock he executed one command many time to free all the partition.

It's very hard to take this decision for me , because at that time i do not know anything about the ubuntu version of linux. But when i shifted ,it was easy to execute same as windows does. It has very good GUI(Graphic User Interface) and I liked that it was most enjoyable part but when I installed  Ubuntu many problems occured at the that  time. I am listing some problems below.</p>\n<h3>Installation Problem</h3>\n<p>I boot my pendrive with ubuntu18.04LTS and then  poweroff the laptop and start pressing F12 . Usually this is the key to open the boot sequence. Practically at that time i have no knowledge of installing an operating system in a laptop, so this is my first attemt for installing an operating system by myself. I completed installation steps and then a confusing page occured in which i have to delete the earliar OS from harddrive , I can't recognise which part to delete  because the format was  in sda or in its technical term so I have to calculate my partitions in hard disk so I quit that process and remove the pendrive. After that I reboot the laptop and calculate the partitons in windowa OS and again boot the pendrive . But when I again reach that step,the calculated partition in windows format and installing format were differrent. But when  I apply some approximation and deleted one partition and  when the installtion was  completed then I rebooted my laptop it shows an error message.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://blog.prashantpandey9.in/static/40f03fb07e904f2ed8182d727f1fdb16/3cd52/linux2.png\" alt=\"error\"></p>\n<p>At that time I did'nt recognise why this error is poping up on my  laptop screen.\nI was nervous what happened to my laptop and then I rebooted it  again with my pen drive and started installation again, but when process completed , the error message remained constant. Then I asked my brother for help and  he gave me a link \"How to fix the booting sequence of laptop in BIOS manager\" .</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Be  yourself; Everyone else is already taken.\nâ€” Oscar Wilde.</p>\n</blockquote>"}}}},
