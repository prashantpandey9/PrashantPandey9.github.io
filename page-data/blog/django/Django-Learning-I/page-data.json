I started a project name todoapp which stores the daily work deatil and delete when  things are over. I have no idea how to create this type of app with django framework, so i googled it and found some stuff about creating a todoapp.</p>\n<p>I started creating the app  with full  enthusiasm. But  not able to create it by my own.I copied some code from google and migrate all the data into database and try to run the server. But I don't know why, the app created problem.I have no idea what's going with that code. I tried to remove error,  some effort got success but some effort not enough to remove the error.</p>\n<p>So till now that app is not working!!!</p>"},"next":{"frontmatter":{"title":"Linux Story II","date":"2019-09-15","path":"/blog/Linux-Story-II/Linux-Story-II"},"html":"<p>When ubuntu installation completed I booted my laptop and it starts working again and I enjoyed the moment. But after some days when i checked my harddrive and started creating a folder it shows some error again. The folder is not created and then I start deleting the existing folder but it shows an error again. Then I started searching \"How to change read/write of a folder in a drive?\" and executed many commands related to this like $chmod 777 ~/file path but this changed the property of folder but not the harddrive partition.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://blog.prashantpandey9.in/static/714c8dc29822f7719c6d8277dcbc3e70/dba9a/error.png\" alt=\"commands\"></p>\n<p>Then I again searched for so many commands and executed them all but nothing happened. So I decided to ask to my brother again and he suggested the same solution which I executed earlier. Then he decided to  check my laptop  from his place, so i added \"Chrome Remote Desktop\" in Google Chrome. Then he checked the problem but nothing happened, and then he started searching problem again and this time he came up with a problem and its solution. The problem arrived from the Windows OS . When I removed the Windows Os from the PC, the Harddrive is locked due to its security purposes and then we found the solution.</p>\n<p>To fix the NTFS lock he executed one command many time to free all the partition. The command to fix ntfs lock is sudo ntfsfix  /dev/sda(1-4).</p>"},"post":{"node":{"frontmatter":{"title":"Django Learning I","date":"2019-11-04","path":"/blog/django/Django-Learning-I"},"html":"<h3>Week I</h3>\n<p>From many weeks I was thinking about to learn so  many things but I was confused to choose , So I decided to learn a framework beacause in today's senerio it was a good start.
