At the first time i choose to learn the LARAVEL FRAMEWORK so i decided to install the laravel package in my system and tried to start some stuff by searching  the basic project in laravel. Then i come up with a search \"How to create a contact from with a laravel framework\" and i also take help by my elder brother. So we started a project file and copied some code from google. At the final we are able to setup the enviroment and created the whole contact form in just 15 min (Including Backend and Frontend) but i struggled with many problem in laravel and then i decided to search something related this framework. Then i decided to learn the Django Framework (beacuse i am comfortable with python).</p>\n<p>I recently installed the django environment in my system and start doing something. When i started doing some stuff in django. My interest kept growing day by day.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Django Learning I","date":"November, 04, 2019","path":"/blog/django/Django-Learning-I"}}},"pageContext":{"previous":{"frontmatter":{"title":"Trouble Maker","date":"2020-01-11","path":"/blog/Trouble/Trouble-Maker"},"html":"<p>If you are afraid of something, like you are stuck or your attempt of doing something is failing for you, then read the whole story in this post.</p>\n<p>Yesterday I shared my whole laptop screen using a chrome-remote-desktop with windows operated machine and mine was Linux(ubuntu) and something happened strange in my machine.

NTFS fixing error is common for Ubuntu and Windows OS in a shared machine because they share the same machine and also the same hard disk so the harddisk is automatically locked down due to this, and these type of error are easy to fix with <code>sudo ntfsfix /dev/&#x3C;device-name></code> when you want to use only Linux OS.</p>\n<p>If you are demotivated after giving your 100% to this problem and couldn't able to fix that error so please calm down because for every success you have to face some problem and also you have to keep walking because something good always is waiting for you.</p>\n<p>After using so many commands copied from the google, I was able to fix that error but for the short time and that command is :</p>\n<p><code>sudo mount -t /dev/&#x3C;disk-name> /media/&#x3C;user>/&#x3C;mounting-folder> </code></p>\n<p>But this command fix is temporary because when I reboot my system it shows the same error again. Then I realized to go to the starting point that I started. Then I searched exactly that \"Mount drive: Not Authorized to perform operation\" and the answer was finally there waiting for me, so always remember one thing that if you are searching in google so keep your search exactly related to the context.</p>\n<p>Finally, after so many attempts the answer was very simple and it was to remove the chrome finally, after so many attempts the answer was very simple and it was to remove the chrome-remote-desktop from your system and kill that process using <code>sudo autoremove chrome-remote-desktop</code> and everything came back easily.</p>\n<p><span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 650px; \"\n    >\n      <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n    style=\"padding-bottom: 50.306748466257666%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/png;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n  ></span>\n  <picture>\n          <source\n              srcset=\"/static/dd73af9c575d1de1f67c6f6a5bc112ab/94563/trouble2.webp 163w,\n/static/dd73af9c575d1de1f67c6f6a5bc112ab/647a8/trouble2.webp 325w,\n/static/dd73af9c575d1de1f67c6f6a5bc112ab/c1dc5/trouble2.webp 650w,\n/static/dd73af9c575d1de1f67c6f6a5bc112ab/1e975/trouble2.webp 975w,\n/static/dd73af9c575d1de1f67c6f6a5bc112ab/a9a89/trouble2.webp 1024w\"\n              sizes=\"(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px\"\n              type=\"image/webp\"\n            />\n          <source\n            srcset=\"/static/dd73af9c575d1de1f67c6f6a5bc112ab/222b7/trouble2.png 163w,\n/static/dd73af9c575d1de1f67c6f6a5bc112ab/ff46a/trouble2.png 325w,\n/static/dd73af9c575d1de1f67c6f6a5bc112ab/a6d36/trouble2.png 650w,\n/static/dd73af9c575d1de1f67c6f6a5bc112ab/e548f/trouble2.png 975w,\n/static/dd73af9c575d1de1f67c6f6a5bc112ab/2bef9/trouble2.png 1024w\"\n            sizes=\"(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px\"\n            type=\"image/png\"\n          />\n          <img\n            class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n            src=\"/static/dd73af9c575d1de1f67c6f6a5bc112ab/a6d36/trouble2.png\"\n            alt=\"trouble2\"\n            title=\"trouble2\"\n            loading=\"lazy\"\n            decoding=\"async\"\n            style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\"\n          />\n        </picture>\n    </span></p>\n<p>The whole motto of this post is, you have to keep working whatever you are doing !!!

After this we have to create the model for our project like ,if we are developing a contact page we need a Textblock  for name and E-mail  box. So we can add these fields in model.py to create a table to store these things in it. After creating a model we have to migrate the model into the database. Generally Django uses  its default database called sqlite. After all this we need views.py ,model.py and urls.py to connect them and put all the data to a html file which displays all the data which we are taking from a user or putting in it.</p>\n<p>The confusing thing about Django is that you often need 4 different but interconnected files for one webpage: models.py, urls.py, views.py, and a template html file.I find it easiest to reason about this by going in order from models -> urls -> views -> template files.</p>"},"post":{"node":{"frontmatter":{"title":"उलझन।","date":"2019-12-04","path":"/blog/poem/उलझन।"},"html":"<p>उन किस्सों को खत्म कर ,<br>\nउन बातों की उलझने खत्म कर ,<br>\nक्या मिला उन बातों को बोल कर,<br>\nआज भी उसी दर्द में जी रहा है तू!<br>\nप्यार की नाकामयाबी को भुला,<br>\nजिंदगी की उलझनों को सुलझा।</p>\n<p>चल एक नई शुरुआत करते है,<br>\nज़िंदगी के कठिन रास्तों पर एक साथ चलते हैं।<br>\nचल इस दोस्ती को मिसाल बनाकर नए रास्तों को खोजने निकलते है।<br>\nचल एक साथ चलते हैं।<br>\nचल एक साथ चलते हैं।<br>\n-प्रशांत</p>"}}}},
